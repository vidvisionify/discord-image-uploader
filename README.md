# üñºÔ∏è Discord ‚Üí GitHub Image Uploader

### Host VRChat images directly from Discord uploads
This project automatically uploads images posted in a specific Discord channel to a GitHub repository ‚Äî perfect for hosting textures, posters, or image assets that can be downloaded in VRChat (e.g., for use with Udon‚Äôs image downloader or dynamic texture systems).

Images are:
- Automatically resized to **1024√ó1024 PNG**    
- Uploaded to GitHub with **commit messages** taken from your Discord message text    
- Added to a simple **gallery.html** for easy viewing    
- Each commit message becomes the **alt text** for that image

### Attention: This script is made by AI.
I wasn't able to find a project to do exactly what I wanted, so I used ChatGPT instead of struggling for weeks.
While I would never use genAI to create images or video, I don't see (as much) harm in simple code like this. IDK, I might backpedal on this at some point, I'm a simple creature that can only handle so many ethics questions.

1. Go to [GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer Settings ‚Üí Fine-grained Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)    
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)** or **fine-grained token**

    - **Permissions**:        
        - _Contents ‚Üí Read and Write_            
4. Copy your token ‚Äî you‚Äôll add it to the `.env` file    

---
### 3. Prepare Your Repository
- Create (or use) a GitHub repo that will store your images.    
- The bot will upload images to a folder (e.g., `/uploads/`) and maintain a `gallery.html` in the root directory.
---
### 4. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

`DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token GITHUB_REPO=YourUsername/YourRepoName GITHUB_BRANCH=main IMAGE_FILENAME_BASE=poster GITHUB_PATH=uploads/`

---
### 5. Run with Docker Compose

`version: "3.9" services:   discord-image-uploader:     build: .     container_name: discord-image-uploader     restart: always     environment:       - DISCORD_TOKEN=${DISCORD_TOKEN}       - DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=${DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID}       - GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}       - GITHUB_REPO=${GITHUB_REPO}       - GITHUB_BRANCH=${GITHUB_BRANCH}       - IMAGE_FILENAME_BASE=${IMAGE_FILENAME_BASE}       - GITHUB_PATH=${GITHUB_PATH}`

Start it:

`docker compose up -d`

## üñºÔ∏è How It Works
1. The bot watches your configured Discord channel.    
2. When an image is posted:    
    - It downloads and resizes the image to 1024√ó1024        
    - Saves it as:        
        - `${IMAGE_FILENAME_BASE}.png`            
        - `${IMAGE_FILENAME_BASE}_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png`            
    - Commits both to GitHub with your Discord message as the commit message        
    - Updates `gallery.html` with the image and alt text (commit message)

## üéÆ VRChat Integration Example
You can use these uploaded images in your **VRChat worlds** using Udon‚Äôs image downloaders or dynamic materials.
For example, if your repository is public:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName/main/uploads/poster.png`

That URL can be used as the source for:
- **Udon Image Loader scripts**    
- **Dynamic Texture systems**    
- **In-game poster replacements**    
- **Live gallery walls**    

The bot effectively becomes a **Discord ‚Üí VRChat image pipeline**, letting you update in-world visuals just by posting new images in Discord.
